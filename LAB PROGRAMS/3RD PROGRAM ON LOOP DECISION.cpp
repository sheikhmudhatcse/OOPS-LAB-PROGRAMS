/*
Write a program to process a collection of daily high temperatures. Your program should
count and print the number of hot days (high temperature 85 or higher), the number of
pleasant days (high temperature 60–84),and the number of cold days (high temperatures
less than 60). It should also display the category of each temperature. Test your program
on the following data:
55 62 68 74 59 45 41 58 60 67 65 78 82 88 91
92 90 93 87 80 78 79 72 68 61 59
