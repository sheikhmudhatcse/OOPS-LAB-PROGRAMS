/*
Keith’s Sheet Music needs a program to implement its music teacher’s discount policy.The
program prompts the user to enter the purchase total and indicate whether the purchaser is a teacher.
Music teachers receive a 10% discount on their sheet music purchases unless the purchase total is
$100 or higher. In that case, the discount is 12%. The discount calculation occurs before the
addition of the 5% sales tax. Here are two sample outputs —one for a teacher and one for a
nonteacher. Use necessary manipulators to format your output.
 (For Teacher)
Total purchases $122.00
Teacher's discount (12%) 14.64
Discounted total 107.36
Sales tax (5%) 5.37
Total $112.73
 (For Non-teacher)
Total purchases $ 24.90
Sales tax (5%) 1.25
Total $ 26.15
