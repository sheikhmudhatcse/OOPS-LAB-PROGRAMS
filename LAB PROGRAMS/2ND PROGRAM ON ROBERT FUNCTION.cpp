/*
Raising a number n to a power p is the same as multiplying n by itself p times. Write a
function called power() that takes a double value for n and an int value for p, and
returns the result as a double value. Use a default argument of 2 for p, so that if this
argument is omitted, the number n will be squared. Write a main() function that gets values from the user to test this function
