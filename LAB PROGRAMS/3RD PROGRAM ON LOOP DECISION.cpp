/*
Write a program to process a collection of daily high temperatures. Your program should
count and print the number of hot days (high temperature 85 or higher), the number of
pleasant days (high temperature 60â€“84),and the number of cold days (high temperatures
less than 60). It should also display the category of each temperature. Test your program
on the following data:
55 62 68 74 59 45 41 58 60 67 65 78 82 88 91
92 90 93 87 80 78 79 72 68 61 59
